<h1>Key Mappings</h1>
<hr>
<p>
J has both global and local key maps. There is a single global key map that
provides the default key mappings for all buffers. Each buffer also has a local
key map that depends on the <a href="modes.html">mode</a> of the buffer. A key
assignment defined in the local key map for a given buffer overrides any
assignment of the same key (or key combination) in the global key map.
<p>
Each entry in a key map defines a binding between a "key combination" and one
of j's commands. A key combination may be just a single keystroke, like
Backspace or Enter or F2. A key combination may also involve one or more of the
four modifier keys (Ctrl, Shift, Alt, and Meta), as in Shift F2 or Ctrl Alt S.
<p>
Every time you type a key or key combination, j begins by looking it up in the
local key map.  If there's no entry for that key or key combination in
the local key map, j then looks in the global key map. If it's not found
there either, and if the key or key combination corresponds (in j's opinion) to
a "normal" character, that character is inserted in the buffer at the
location of the caret.
<p>
You can use the command <a href="commands.html#describeKey">describeKey</a>,
mapped by default to Alt K and available on the Help menu, to see what command
is mapped to a specific key or key combination in the current buffer.
<p>
Not all commands have key mappings by default. Even if a command is not mapped
to any key or key combination, you can use still execute it with
<a href="commands.html#executeCommand">executeCommand</a>, which is mapped by
default to Alt X and available on the File menu ("Execute Command..."). You
will be prompted to enter the name of the command in the location bar.
<p>
The commands <a href="commands.html#writeGlobalKeyMap">writeGlobalKeyMap</a> and
<a href="commands.html#writeLocalKeyMap">writeLocalKeyMap</a> may be used to
write out the current global or local key map, as the case may be, to a file
you specify, as ordinary text.
<p>
The command <a href="commands.html#listBindings">listBindings</a>, available
on the Help menu ("Key Bindings"), displays a list of all the key bindings in
effect in the current buffer.
<p>
All of j's key assignments may be changed by the user. To replace the global
key map, for example, add a line like this to your
<a href="preferences.html">preferences</a> file:
<pre>
    globalKeyMap=/home/peter/.j/globalkeys
</pre>
This line instructs j to read its global key map from the specified file. This
file must be in the format written out by
<a href="commands.html#writeGlobalKeyMap">writeGlobalKeyMap</a> and
<a href="commands.html#writeLocalKeyMap">writeLocalKeyMap</a>.
<p>
You can also replace mode-specific key maps:
<pre>
    JavaMode.keyMap=/home/peter/.j/javakeys
</pre>
If there's no entry in your preferences file for a particular key map, j will
use its built-in defaults.
<p>
The easiest way to customize a key map is to write out the corresponding
default key map using
<a href="commands.html#writeGlobalKeyMap">writeGlobalKeyMap</a> or
<a href="commands.html#writeLocalKeyMap">writeLocalKeyMap</a>, edit the
resulting file, and then add a line to your
<a href="preferences.html">preferences</a> file pointing to the modified key
map (as in the examples above).
<p>
Sometimes it may not be obvious what text string to use to specify a particular key
combination.  You can use <a href="commands.html#insertKeyText">insertKeyText</a>
to insert the appropriate text string in the key map you're editing.
<p>
A very small number of commands (currently only
<a href="commands.html#insertString">insertString</a> and
<a href="commands.html#help">help</a>, but there will be more in the future)
require (or accept) an argument (which in the current implementation must be a
quoted string). Such commands can be added to a key map like this:
<pre>
    Ctrl Alt X                      insertString("e.printStackTrace();")
</pre>
<p>
Key maps can contain blank lines and comments. A comment is any line whose
first non-whitespace character is '#'.
<p>
You can use the command
<a href="commands.html#reloadKeyMaps">reloadKeyMaps</a> to force j to reload
your key maps after you have edited them.
<p>
J will reload your key maps automatically after you edit them (and save the
changes) if you add this line to your
<a href="preferences.html">preferences</a> file:
<pre>
    autoReloadKeyMaps = true</pre>
<p>
The command <a href="commands.html#defaultKeyMaps">defaultKeyMaps</a> discards
all custom key mappings and returns to j's internal defaults.
<p>
You can also use <a href="init.lisp.html">init.lisp</a> to make changes to
the default key mappings without having to define a full set of custom key
maps.
<p>
If you combine custom key maps with ad hoc mappings in init.lisp, note that
reloading a key map will discard any ad hoc mappings in the same scope.
