<p>
Themes are a way to gather together the properties that control the appearance
of the editor.
<p>
The distribution comes with a themes directory which contains several themes. You can
specify the theme to use by setting the <a href="preferences.html#theme">theme</a>
property in your <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a> file:
<pre>
    theme=Anokha
</pre>
The specified theme file is loaded as an additional preferences file after
~/.j/prefs is loaded.
<p>
You can use the <a href="preferences.html#themePath">themePath</a> property
to specify a list of directories that will be searched (in the specified order)
for theme files when the full path of the theme file is not given. For example:
<pre>
    themePath=/home/peter:/home/peter/j/themes:/usr/local/share/j/themes
</pre>
