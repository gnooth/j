<h1>Logging</h1>
<hr>
<p>
J keeps a log of interesting events in the file ~/.j/log (or C:\.j\log). By
default, only errors are logged.
<p>
When debugging is enabled, debugging information is also logged, and all
output sent to the log file is also sent to System.err, so it can be seen in
the console window from which j was started.
<p>
You can enable debugging by adding the following line to your
<a href="preferences.html">preferences</a> file:
<pre>
    debug = true</pre>
<p>
The maximum size of the log file is controlled by the property
<a href="preferences.html#Log.maxFileSize">Log.maxFileSize</a>; the default is
100 KB. When the log file exceeds its maximum size, it is rolled over to the
file ~/.j/log.0, which in turn is rolled over to ~/.j/log.1, etc. The maximum
backup index is controlled by the property
<a href="preferences.html#Log.maxBackupIndex">Log.maxBackupIndex</a>; the
default is zero, which means one backup is made.
<p>
To disable logging entirely, add this line to your
<a href="preferences.html">preferences</a> file:
<pre>
    Log.enabled = false</pre>
<p>
If logging is disabled, nothing will be written to the log file, but if
debugging is enabled, log output will still be sent to System.err.
