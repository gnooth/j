<h1>Sessions</h1>

<p>
By default, information about your editing session is saved so that when you
restart j, things come back more or less as you left them: the same buffers
will be open (except for remote and transient buffers), and the current
location in each buffer will be the same.
</p>
<p>
J also provides support for named sessions with the commands
<a href="commands.html#saveSession">saveSession</a> and
<a href="commands.html#loadSession">loadSession</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="commands.html#saveSession">saveSession</a> saves information about
the current editing session in a named session file. If no named session is
active yet, you will be prompted for a name for the current session;
subsequent saves will go to that session file without further prompting.
</p>
<p>
<a href="commands.html#loadSession">loadSession</a> loads a previously saved
named session, which then becomes the active named session as far as
<a href="commands.html#saveSession">saveSession</a> is concerned. All
currently open buffers are closed before the new session is loaded.
</p>
<p>
If a named session is active, you can save the current session under a new
name by using <a href="commands.html#executeCommand">executeCommand</a> to
invoke <a href="commands.html#saveSession">saveSession</a> with the new name
as an argument (e.g. Alt X, "saveSession foo"). If you do this, subsequent
saves will go to the new session file by default.
</p>
<p>
When a named session is active, the session name appears in the title bar of
the top-level window, enclosed in brackets.
</p>
<p>
By default, the information in a named session file is only updated when you
explicitly invoke <a href="commands.html#saveSession">saveSession</a>. This
allows you to exercise better control over the contents of named session
files. If you'd like named session information to be updated automatically,
add this line to ~/.j/prefs or C:\.j\prefs:
<pre>
    autosaveNamedSessions = true</pre>
<p>
You can use "-session" on the command line to start j with a specific named
session:
<pre>
    j -session foo</pre>
or
<pre>
    java -jar j.jar -session foo</pre>
<p>
When you start j without specifying a named session on the command line, the
previous session is restored, but no named session is active until you do
<a href="commands.html#saveSession">saveSession</a> or
<a href="commands.html#loadSession">loadSession</a>.
</p>
<p>
Named session files are stored in the directory ~/.j/sessions (or
C:\.j\sessions). You might want to visit that directory on your day off and
delete session files that are no longer needed.
