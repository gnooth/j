<h1>Compilation Buffers</h1>

<hr>

<p>
J can run compilers for languages like Java and C, redirecting the output into
a compilation buffer. For some compilers, including javac, jikes, gcc, and
Microsoft C/C++, j can also parse the compiler's error messages and jump to the
location in the source file where the error occurred. (Please note that on
Windows, compilation buffers are only supported for Windows NT 4, Windows 2000
and Windows XP.)
</p>
<p>
The command <a href="commands.html#compile">compile</a>, mapped by default to
F9, can be used to run make,
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">Ant</a>, or a compiler. You
will be prompted for the compile command. The current directory (the directory
of the file in the current buffer) is used as the working directory for the
execution of the compile command, so if you're using make or Ant, the Makefile
or build.xml in the current directory will be used by default.
</p>
<p>
The command <a href="commands.html#recompile">recompile</a>, mapped by default
to Ctrl F9, repeats the last compile command you specified. To make this
command more useful, you can use the dynamic alias "here" in your compile
command to represent the full pathname of the current file (the file in the
current buffer).
<p>
For example, you could specify the compile command:
<pre>
        javac -classpath /home/peter/j/src here</pre>
Then you could use <a href="commands.html#recompile">recompile</a> in any
buffer containing a Java source file to run javac (with the specified
classpath) on that particular file.
<p>
When you start a compilation, j displays the compilation buffer in another
window, splitting the current window if necessary. Keyboard focus remains in
the source window.
</p>
<p>
If the compilation completes without error, you can use
<a href="commands.html#escape">escape</a>, mapped by default to Escape, to
kill the compilation buffer and unsplit the window.
</p>
<p>
If there are errors, you can use the commands
<a href="commands.html#nextError">nextError</a>, mapped by default to F4, and
<a href="commands.html#previousError">previousError</a>, mapped by default to
Shift F4, to jump to the location of each error in the source.
</p>
<p>
In the compilation buffer itself, the command
<a href="commands.html#thisError">thisError</a>, mapped by default to Enter,
jumps to the location in the source file that corresponds to the error message
at the current location of the caret.
(<a href="commands.html#thisError">thisError</a> is also mapped by default to
Ctrl Shift G, left button double click, and middle button single click.)
</p>
<p>
The
command <a href="commands.html#showMessage">showMessage</a>, mapped by default
to Ctrl Shift M, displays the full text of the current error message.
</p>
<p>
Note that when using jikes, you must specify the +D flag in the compile
command (or Makefile) in order for j to be able to parse the error messages
correctly:
<pre>
        jikes +D [...] here</pre>
When using ant, you should set the build.compiler.emacs property:
<pre>
        build.compiler.emacs=on</pre>
