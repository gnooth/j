<h1>CVS Support</h1>

<p>
J provides commands to perform a few common CVS operations that it makes sense
to do from within an editor.
<p>
For these commands to work, CVS must be set up correctly outside of j first. A
CVS operation won't work within j unless it can be performed successfully from
a shell command prompt in the parent directory of the current buffer.
<p>
Most CVS-related commands are not mapped to any keystrokes by default, but you
can use <a href="commands.html#executeCommand">executeCommand</a>, mapped by
default to Alt X, and then type in the name of the command (or just type "cvs"
and then keep hitting Tab until you see the command you want; completion is
your friend).
<p>
CVS revision information for checked-out files is displayed in the status
bar, to the right of the mode name, like this:
<pre>
    CVS 1.34</pre>
or
<pre>
    CVS 1.34 M</pre>
or
<pre>
    CVS A</pre>
<p>
In this example, "1.34" is the revision; it's followed by an 'M' if the file
modification time of the local file is different from the checkout time, which
is often an indication that the local file has been modified since it was
checked out. "CVS A", with no revision number, means the file has been added
to CVS but not yet committed.
<p>
If you're working on a file that's registered with CVS, you can use the
command <a href="commands.html#cvsDiff">cvsDiff</a> to get a diff output
buffer showing the changes between the checked-in version and your local copy.
<a href="commands.html#cvsDiffDir">cvsDiffDir</a> is similar, but it generates
a diff output buffer containing information about all the files in the current
directory and its subdirectories, not just the current buffer. Once you're in
the diff output buffer, you can scroll around and use
<a href="commands.html#diffGotoFile">diffGotoFile</a>, mapped by default to
Enter, to jump to the location in the source file that corresponds to the line
you're on in the diff output buffer. You can use
<a href="commands.html#escape">escape</a>, mapped by default to Escape, to get
rid of the diff output buffer when you're done.
<p>
When you're ready to check in your changes, use the command
<a href="commands.html#cvsCommit">cvsCommit</a>. This command opens a checkin
buffer in which you can compose your checkin comment. When your comment is
ready, use the command <a href="commands.html#finish">finish</a>, mapped by
default to Ctrl Enter in the checkin buffer, to complete the checkin operation.
<p>
If you change several source files for the same reason, it is often convenient
to specify the same checkin comment for several files. To help you do this, j
maintains a history of the checkin comments you've used recently. You can use
the commands <a href="commands.html#previousComment">previousComment</a> and
<a href="commands.html#nextComment">nextComment</a>, mapped by default to Ctrl
P and Ctrl N (respectively) in the checkin buffer, to cycle through this
history list.
<p>
To register the current buffer's file with CVS for the first time, use the
command <a href="commands.html#cvsAdd">cvsAdd</a>.
<p> The generic command <a href="commands.html#cvs">cvs</a>, which requires an
argument, can be used to execute arbitrary CVS commands for which j has no
specific support. The required argument is the CVS command to be executed,
together with any necessary flags. For example:
<pre>
        cvs status -v</pre>
<p>
The name of the file associated with the current buffer is automatically
appended to the command line, so if you're editing a file called Jdb.java, the
command line that CVS sees is actually:
<pre>
        cvs status -v Jdb.java</pre>
<p>
There is one exception: if the argument you supply begins with "-H" (CVS
command-specific help), the filename is not appended. For example:
<pre>
        cvs -H admin</pre>
<p>
The output of the command is displayed in a transient output buffer.
<p>
The following commands are specifically relevant to CVS support:
<ul>
    <li><a href="commands.html#cvs">cvs</a></li>
    <li><a href="commands.html#cvsAdd">cvsAdd</a></li>
    <li><a href="commands.html#cvsCommit">cvsCommit</a></li>
    <li><a href="commands.html#cvsDiff">cvsDiff</a></li>
    <li><a href="commands.html#cvsDiffDir">cvsDiffDir</a></li>
    <li><a href="commands.html#cvsLog">cvsLog</a></li>
    <li><a href="commands.html#finish">finish</a></li>
    <li><a href="commands.html#nextComment">nextComment</a></li>
    <li><a href="commands.html#previousComment">previousComment</a></li>
</ul>
