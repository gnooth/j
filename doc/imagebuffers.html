<h1>Image Buffers</h1>

<hr>

<p>
Image buffers let you view images in several standard formats.
<p>
Image buffers are an experimental feature. If you want to use experimental features,
add this line to your <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a> file:
<pre>
    enableExperimentalFeatures=true
</pre>
You can view an image by opening an image file in any of the normal ways: the
Open File dialog, on the command line when starting j, or from a directory
buffer. <a href="commands.html#gotoFile">gotoFile</a>, mapped by default to
Ctrl Shift G, is particularly handy in HTML and HTTP buffers.
<p>
The directly supported image formats are GIF and JPEG. PNG is also supported directly
if you're running Java 1.3.
<p>
If <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jimi">JIMI</a> is in j's CLASSPATH,
additional formats are available. If you're building j from source, you'll
need to edit the generated shell script and/or batch file manually to add
JimiProClasses.zip to the CLASSPATH.
<p>
J uses a regular expression to control which files are
opened in Image mode. This is the default setting:
<pre>
    ImageMode.files=".+\\.gif|.+\\.jpe?g|.+\\.png"
</pre>
You can change this by specifying a different regular expression in your <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a> file.
(You'll probably want to do this if you use JIMI.)
<p>
In Image mode, the command <a href="commands.html#imageFit">imageFit</a>,
mapped by default to 'f', can be used to scale the image to fit the current
edit window. The aspect ratio of the original image is preserved.
<p>
You can use <a href="commands.html#imageZoomIn">imageZoomIn</a>, mapped by
default to '=', and  <a href="commands.html#imageZoomOut">imageZoomOut</a>,
mapped by default to '-', to zoom in or out on the image.
<p>
<a href="commands.html#imageRestore">imageRestore</a>, mapped by default to
'r', restores the image to its original size.
<p>
<a href="commands.html#imageCycleBackground">imageCycleBackground</a>,
mapped by default to 'c', changes the background color of the image.
You can use this command repeatedly to cycle through a small number of plausible
background colors (currently gray, black and white).
