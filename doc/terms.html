J uses (and, in versions prior to 0.19.0.2, redistributed)
<a href="http://www.megginson.com/SAX/">SAX 2.0</a>, the Simple API for XML,
and the SAX2-ext extension package. SAX 2.0 is in the public domain.

<h2>&AElig;lfred</h2>
<p>
Versions of j prior to 0.19.0.2 included a version of the &AElig;lfred XML
parser, originally from <a href="http://www.microstar.com">Microstar</a>, taken
from the May 29 2000 release by David Brownell.

&AElig;lfred's package name has been changed to org.armedbear.j.aelfred to
prevent any accidental confusion with either the original Microstar code or
David Brownell's version. Only the XML parser and SAX driver are included in the
j distribution.

&AElig;lfred was orginally released by Microstar under the following license:

David Brownell's software is distributed under the following license:
<pre>
    LICENSE

    The intent of this license is to establish freedom to share and change
    the software regulated by this license under the open source model, while
    preserving exclusive rights of the copyright holder to evolve the
    copyrighted interfaces.

    This license applies to any software containing a notice placed by the
    copyright holder saying that it may be distributed under the terms of this
    license.  Such software is herein referred to as the Software.  This
    license covers modification and distribution of the Software, use of
    third-party application programs based on the Software, and development
    of free software which uses the Software.

    1. You are granted the non-exclusive rights set forth in this license
       provided you agree to and comply with any and all conditions in this
       license. Whole or partial distribution of the Software, or software
       items that link with the Software, in any form signifies acceptance
       of this license.

    2. You may copy and distribute the Software in unmodified form provided
       that the entire package, including - but not restricted to - copyright,
       trademark notices and disclaimers, as released by the initial developer
       of the Software, is distributed.

    3. You may make modifications to the Software and distribute your
       modifications, in a form that is separate from the Software, such as
       patches. The following restrictions apply to modifications:

        a. Modifications must not alter or remove any copyright, license,
           trademark, or other notices in the Software.

        b. When modifications to the Software are released under this license,
           a non-exclusive royalty-free right is granted to the initial
           developer of the Software to distribute all or part of your
           modification in future versions of the Software provided such
           versions remain available under these terms in addition to any other
           license(s) of the initial developer.

        c. If the interface to a Java-Compatible (tm) package in the Software has
           changed from the one defined by the copyright holder, the modification
           which is distributed must not use the package name defined by the
           copyright holder.  A partial list of modifications which constitute
           such changes includes the addition or removal of generally visible
           symbols including public classes or interfaces, as well as their public
           or protected members; the copyright holder may provide alternative
           definitions applying to specific packages.  Changes affecting the
           ability to pass such conformance tests as may be defined by the
           copyright holder always constitute interface changes.

        d. Modifications must be provided to the initial developer.

    4. You may distribute machine-executable forms of the Software or
       machine-executable forms of modified versions of the Software,
       provided that you meet these restrictions:

        a. You must include this license document in the distribution.

        b. You must ensure that all recipients of the machine-executable forms
           are also able to receive the complete machine-readable source code
           to the distributed Software, including all modifications, without
           any charge beyond the costs of data transfer, and place prominent
           notices in the distribution explaining this.

        c. You must ensure that all modifications included in the
           machine-executable forms are available under the terms of
           this license.

    5. You may use the original or modified versions of the Software to
       compile, link and run application programs legally developed by you
       or by others.

    6. You may develop application programs, reusable components and other
       software items that link with the original or modified versions of the
       Software. These items, when distributed, are subject to the following
       requirements:

        a. You must ensure that all recipients of machine-executable forms
           of these items are also able to receive and use the complete
           machine-readable source code to the items without any charge
           beyond the costs of data transfer.

        b. You must explicitly license all recipients of your items to use
           and re-distribute original and modified versions of the items in
           both machine-executable and source code forms.  The recipients
           must be able to do so without any charges whatsoever, and they
           must be able to re-distribute to anyone they choose.

        c. If the items are not available to the general public, and the
           initial developer of the Software requests a copy of the items,
           then you must supply one.

    IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR INITIAL DEVELOPER BE LIABLE FOR
    ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS
    OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION)
    HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
    STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN
    ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

    THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND INITIAL DEVELOPER
    "AS IS" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
