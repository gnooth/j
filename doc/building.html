<h1>Building the Source</h1>

<hr>

<p>
<b>Using configure and make</b>
<p>
This is the recommended build system on Unix platforms. On Windows, you are
more likely to succeed with Ant; see <a href="#Using_Ant">below</a>.
<p>
For Linux:

<pre>
    $ ./configure --with-jdk=DIR
    $ make
    $ make install
</pre>

The <code>--with-jdk</code> option is <b>always</b> required,
in order to specify which JDK to use (give the full path of its top-level directory).
<p>
On Mac OS X, the --with-jdk option should be specified like this:
<pre>
    --with-jdk=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework
</pre>
<p>
You can use the <code>--with-extensions</code> option to specify extensions to
the <code>CLASSPATH</code>. For example, you may want to build j with support
for an external XML parser:
<pre>
    $ ./configure ... --with-extensions=/usr/share/java/xerces.jar
</pre>
Extensions specified in this way are added to the <code>CLASSPATH</code> both
during the build process and at runtime.
<p>
<a name="jpty"></a>If you want to use certain experimental features such as
shell and ssh buffers, you should specify the <code>--enable-jpty</code> option
(you will also need to set <code>enableExperimentalFeatures=true</code> in your
<a href="preferences.html">preferences</a> file).
<p>
By default, j will be installed in /usr/local/bin.
<p>
After you've built and installed j, you should be able to invoke it from the
command line by just typing
<pre>
    $ j
</pre>
if /usr/local/bin is in your path.
<p>
<b><a name="Using_Ant">Using Ant</a></b>
<p>
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant">Ant</a> is the recommended build system
on Windows. Version 1.4.1 or later of Ant is required.
<p>
Change into the root directory of the j source distribution and edit the file
build.properties to suit your situation. Then:
<pre>
    C:\j-0.21.0> ant all
</pre>
This will build j.jar and generate a batch file, j.bat, that you can use to
launch j.
