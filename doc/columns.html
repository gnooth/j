<h1>Columns</h1>

<hr>

<p>
    Cut, copy and paste operations are supported on columns (rectangular areas
    of text), as well as on ordinary regions.
</p>
<p>
    To mark a column, put the caret at one corner of the desired area and
    control shift left click with the mouse at the opposite corner. If things
    go well, the column will be highlighted appropriately.
</p>
<p>
    Once a column is marked, the commands 
    <a href="commands.html#copyRegion">copyRegion</a>, mapped by default to
    Ctrl C, <a href="commands.html#killRegion">killRegion</a>, mapped by
    default to Ctrl X, and <a href="commands.html#delete">delete</a>, mapped
    by default to Delete, act on the marked column.
</p>
<p>
    The contents of the last column to be copied or killed are saved, and can
    subsequently be retrieved with the command 
    <a href="commands.html#pasteColumn">pasteColumn</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Copied or killed columns are not stored in the kill ring, so 
    <a href="commands.html#cyclePaste">cyclePaste</a> cannot be used with
    columns.
