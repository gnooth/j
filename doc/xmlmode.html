<h1>XML Mode</h1>

<hr>

<p>
In XML mode, the bottom pane of the sidebar normally displays a tree
representing the document you're editing. The tree is enabled by default. To
disable it, add the following line to your
<a href="preferences.html">preferences</a> file:
<pre>
    XmlMode.enableTree = false
</pre>
<p>
If the tree is enabled but no tree appears in the sidebar, the most likely
reason is that j's XML parser was unable to parse the contents of the buffer.
Parsing is done in a background thread, so it may take a little while for the
tree to appear (or possibly a long while, if the document references a DTD on
the Internet, for example).
<p>
Starting with version 0.19.0.2, j uses the XML parser provided as part of the
Java 1.4 runtime library. (Earlier versions of j included a version of the
&AElig;lfred XML parser.)
<p>
If you would rather use a different XML parser, you need to do two things:
<ul>
<li>
Add the relevant jar file(s) to j's runtime <code>CLASSPATH</code>. If you
build j from source, you can use the configure script's
<code>--with-extensions</code> option to do this:
<pre>
        ./configure --with-extensions=/usr/share/java/xercesImpl.jar
</pre>
The j shell script that is automatically generated and installed will then use
the correct <code>CLASSPATH</code>.
<br><br>
</li>
<li>
Add a line to your <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a> file to specify
the <a href="preferences.html#org.xml.sax.driver">org.xml.sax.driver</a>
property, which tells j the fully qualified class name of the parser to use.
For example:
<pre>
        org.xml.sax.driver = org.apache.xerces.parsers.SAXParser
</pre>
(The corresponding property in versions of j prior to 0.19.0.2 was
"org.xml.sax.parser".)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
When you have a tree in the sidebar, the selection in the tree will follow
along as you navigate in the edit buffer, but the tree is not automatically
expanded to show nested nodes. You can use
<a href="commands.html#xmlFindCurrentNode">xmlFindCurrentNode</a>, mapped by
default to Ctrl =, to force the tree to expand all the way down to the node
corresponding to the location of the caret in the edit buffer.
<p>
Clicking on a node in the tree moves the caret to the corresponding
location in the edit buffer.
<p>
The tree is refreshed automatically by the idle thread when you make changes to
the buffer.
<p>
You can also use <a href="commands.html#xmlParseBuffer">xmlParseBuffer</a>,
mapped by default to Ctrl P, to force the tree to be refreshed. The parser uses
the image of the buffer in memory, rather than the file on disk, so there's no
need to save any changes you've made to the buffer before refreshing the tree.
<p>
If <a href="commands.html#xmlParseBuffer">xmlParseBuffer</a> encounters an
error, the tree is not updated.
<p>
Parser errors that occur when j is automatically refreshing the tree are not reported.
<p>
<a href="commands.html#xmlParseBuffer">xmlParseBuffer</a> invokes
<a href="commands.html#xmlFindCurrentNode">xmlFindCurrentNode</a> automatically
when it succeeds in updating the tree.
<p>
The following commands are also specifically relevant in XML mode:
<ul>
<li><a href="commands.html#xmlElectricEquals">xmlElectricEquals</a></li>
<li><a href="commands.html#xmlFindMatch">xmlFindMatch</a></li>
<li><a href="commands.html#xmlInsertEmptyElementTag">xmlInsertEmptyElementTag</a></li>
<li><a href="commands.html#xmlInsertTag">xmlInsertTag</a></li>
<li><a href="commands.html#xmlValidateBuffer">xmlValidateBuffer</a></li>
</ul>
