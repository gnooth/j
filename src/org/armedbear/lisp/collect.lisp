;;; Collect-Normal-Expander  --  Internal
;;;
;;;    This function does the real work of macroexpansion for normal collection
;;; macros.  N-Value is the name of the variable which holds the current
;;; value.  Fun is the function which does collection.  Forms is the list of
;;; forms whose values we are supposed to collect.

    ,@(mapcar #'(lambda (form) `(setq ,n-value (,fun ,form ,n-value))) forms)

;;; Collect-List-Expander  --  Internal
;;;
;;;    This function deals with the list collection case.  N-Tail is the pointer
;;; to the current tail of the list, which is NIL if the list is empty.
;;;

(defmacro collect (collections &body body)
  "Collect ({(Name [Initial-Value] [Function])}*) {Form}*
  Collect some values somehow.  Each of the collections specifies a bunch of
  things which collected during the evaluation of the body of the form.  The
  name of the collection is used to define a local macro, a la MACROLET.
  Within the body, this macro will evaluate each of its arguments and collect
  the result, returning the current value after the collection is done.  The
  body is evaluated as a PROGN; to get the final values when you are done, just
  call the collection macro with no arguments.

  Initial-Value is the value that the collection starts out with, which
  defaults to NIL.  Function is the function which does the collection.  It is
  a function which will accept two arguments: the value to be collected and the
  current collection.  The result of the function is made the new value for the
  collection.  As a totally magical special-case, the Function may be Collect,
  which tells us to build a list in forward order; this is the default.  If an
  Initial-Value is supplied for Collect, the stuff will be rplacd'd onto the
  end.  Note that Function may be anything that can appear in the functional
  position, including macros and lambdas."
