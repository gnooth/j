;;; Each time we start dribbling to a new stream, we put it in
;;; *DRIBBLE-STREAM*, and push a list of *DRIBBLE-STREAM*, *STANDARD-INPUT*,
;;; *STANDARD-OUTPUT* and *ERROR-OUTPUT* in *PREVIOUS-DRIBBLE-STREAMS*.
;;; *STANDARD-OUTPUT* and *ERROR-OUTPUT* is changed to a broadcast stream that
;;; broadcasts to *DRIBBLE-STREAM* and to the old values of the variables.
;;; *STANDARD-INPUT* is changed to an echo stream that echos input from the old
;;; value of standard input to *DRIBBLE-STREAM*.
;;;
;;; When dribble is called with no arguments, *DRIBBLE-STREAM* is closed,
;;; and the values of *DRIBBLE-STREAM*, *STANDARD-INPUT*, and
;;; *STANDARD-OUTPUT* are popped from *PREVIOUS-DRIBBLE-STREAMS*.

;;; From SBCL.
